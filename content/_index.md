# My personal phylactery

I have tried and failed to create a personal blog, many, many times (just check my GitHub profile for `FirstTry`, `FirstTry2`, `SecondTry`, etc.). I think the source of all my woes is getting stuck doing all the setup work, trying to make something optimal, and never actually getting to the fun. That's why I'm ripping the bandaid off, and just putting something out there. Maybe I'll kill this site in favor of something else in the future, but for now, I'm here to stay. 

The theme for this site was created by [Jan Raasch](https://www.janraasch.com), and was based on the wonderful blogging platform [BearBlog](https://bearblog.dev/), founded by Herman Martinus. I'm thankful for both their hard work, I've always appreciated that OpenSource is founded on the kindness of strangers.

If you're visiting this site, you're most likely either a bot, a family member, or I have done something to become suddenly famous (or infamous). In any case, you'll probably benefit from learning more about [me]({{< ref "about.md"}}).
